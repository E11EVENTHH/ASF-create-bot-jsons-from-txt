# Setting up
- Fill in Files/logpass.txt with your logins and passwords separating them with ":"
- Edit Files/JSON_sample.txt to the view you need, this is how the JSON files of the bots will look like (leave templog and temppass as they are, they will be replaced by login and password during work)
- Run Start.bat and wait for the script to complete its work
- Ready jsons are in Files/JSONS
